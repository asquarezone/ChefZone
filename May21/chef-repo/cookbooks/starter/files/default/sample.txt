This is a Chef Infra cookbook file. It is used to copy content verbatim on to a server.
For dynamic or otherwise data-driven content, please see sample.erb in the templates/
directory for an example of using a template resource.

You can create a cookbook_file resource in a recipe file:

    cookbook_file '/etc/myserver.conf' do
      source 'sample.txt'
      owner 'root'
      group 'root'
      mode '644'
    end

A cookbook_file resource can be used with any context, including binary files.

For further information, see the [Chef documentation](https://docs.chef.io/files/).
